Project Overview: Financial Asset Price Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a sophisticated predictive model capable of forecasting financial asset prices with high accuracy. By leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, the model seeks to identify underlying patterns and trends in historical market data to inform future price movements. The goal is to create a robust and reliable tool for traders, investors, and financial institutions to make data-driven decisions. 

- Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is employed as a fundamental building block for modeling the stochastic nature of asset prices. While it serves as a foundational model, its limitations in capturing complex market dynamics are acknowledged. Therefore, the project incorporates GBM as a benchmark and explores more advanced models to enhance predictive accuracy. 


Key components of the project include:

- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Sourcing and cleaning historical financial   data, including price, volume, and relevant market indicators.

- Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw data to enhance model performance, incorporating GBM-derived features where applicable.

- Model Development and Training: Implementing and training a variety of predictive models, including those based on GBM, as well as advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

- Model Evaluation: Rigorously assessing model accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics, comparing results against the GBM baseline.

- Model Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters and architecture to achieve optimal results, potentially incorporating GBM enhancements or hybrid models.

By combining the theoretical foundation of GBM with the flexibility and power of modern machine learning, this project seeks to create a robust and accurate financial forecasting tool.
